Signal processing - refers to the science of analyzing time-varying physical processes
    Analog/Continuous-time Signal - continuous waveform 
    Digital/Discrete-time Signal - quantized time-independent variable

Sine Wave
    x(n) = sin(2pi * F * n * T_s)
    F = 1/P - Frequency
    P = N * T_s - Period of one cycle in seconds
    N = P/T_s - Number of samples in one period
    T_s = Sampling period - time between each sample
    F_s = Sampling rate - How many samples per second

Time Domain - representation of the amplitude of over time
Frequency Domain - representation of the amplitude and phase of frequencies in the signal
